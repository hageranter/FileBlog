When you step into the Colosseum, it doesn’t feel like visiting a ruin—it feels like entering a story. The echoes of roaring crowds, the scent of history, the weight of empire—it all lingers in the air.</p>

<p>A Monument to Power
Built in AD 72 under Emperor Vespasian, the Colosseum once held over 50,000 spectators. It was Rome’s grand theater for gladiators, wild animals, and mock sea battles.</p>

<p>Layers of the Arena
Beneath the floor lies the hypogeum, a network of tunnels where animals and fighters awaited their fate. Touring it feels like a backstage pass to ancient drama.</p>
