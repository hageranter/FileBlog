 The Lost City Rediscovered
Machu Picchu, built in the 15th century by the Inca emperor Pachacuti, was hidden from the world for centuries. It wasn’t until 1911 that Hiram Bingham, an American explorer, brought its beauty to global attention. But the locals? They’d always known it was there—guarded by mist and memory.
